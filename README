This repo contains most of my configuration file for working environment,
containing:
    vimrc
    zshrc
    bashrc

Usage:
    run the setup.sh script, which 1). moves existing config files in $HOME to
    a backup directory; and 2). creates symlinks in $HOME to the above config
    files in the repo. By default, the repo and the backup directory is sitting
    in $HOME. Set it in setup.sh if otherwise.
